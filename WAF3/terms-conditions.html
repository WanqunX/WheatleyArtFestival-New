<h3>DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (DMCA) NOTICE AND POLICY</h3>

<p>We respect the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that any material
available on or through the Site infringes upon any copyright you own or control, please
immediately notify our Designated Copyright Agent using the contact information
provided below (a “Notification”). A copy of your Notification will be sent to the person
who posted or stored the material addressed in the Notification. Please be advised that
pursuant to UK civil law you may be held liable for damages if you make material
misrepresentations in a Notification. Thus, if you are not sure that material located on or

<p>If you believe your own copyrighted material has been removed from the Site as a result
of a mistake or misidentification, you may submit a written counter notification to [us/our
Designated Copyright Agent] using the contact information provided below (a “Counter
Notification”). To be an effective Counter Notification under the DMCA, your Counter

<p> (1) identification of the material that
has been removed or disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it
was removed or disabled; </p>
<p>(2) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the
Federal District Court in which your address is located, or if your address is outside the

<p>(4) your name, address, and telephone number; </p>
<p>(5) a statement under penalty of perjury
that you have a good faith belief that the material in question was removed or disabled as

restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question. Please
note that if you materially misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was
removed by mistake or misidentification, you may be liable for damages, including costs
and attorney’s fees. Filing a false Counter Notification constitutes perjury.</p>

CONDITIONS OF USE, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION
AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITE
(INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH
OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR
REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE SITE
OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU
POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.
If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from
registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or

addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take
appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive

<h3>MODIFICATIONS AND INTERRUPTIONS</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the Site at any time or
for any reason at our sole discretion without notice. However, we have no obligation to
update any information on our Site. We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue all
or part of the Site without notice at any time. We will not be liable to you or any third party
for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Site.
We cannot guarantee the Site will be available at all times. We may experience
hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the
Site, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise,
update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Site at any time or for any reason

downtime or discontinuance of the Site. Nothing in these Terms of Use will be construed
to obligate us to maintain and support the Site or to supply any corrections, updates, or
releases in connection therewith.</p>
<h3>GOVERNING LAW</h3>
<p>
These Terms and Conditions of Use and your use of the Site are governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom &amp; Northern Ireland
applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the above-specified
territory, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

<h3>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
<p>Informal Negotiations<p>
<p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related
to these Terms and Conditions of Use (each a “Dispute” and collectively, the “Disputes”)
brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the
Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such
informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.
Binding Arbitration<p>
	
If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute
(except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved
by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU
WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The
arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone,
or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement
of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law,
and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise
required by the applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Kent County, UK. Except
as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the
award entered by the arbitrator.
If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be
commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Kent County, UK,
and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction,
and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such county and
crown courts.
In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be
commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is
found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
court.
Restrictions
The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties
individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or
authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of

the general public or any other persons.
Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration
The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to
enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a
Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is
found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such
Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that
court.
CORRECTIONS
There may be information on the Site that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or
omissions, including descriptions, pricing, availability, and various other information. We
reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions and to change or
update the information on the Site at any time, without prior notice.
