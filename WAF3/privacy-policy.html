					<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
					<p>When you use our website, you trust us to handle your personal
details properly. We understand that this is a huge responsibility and
work really hard to manage your information and put you in control.
This privacy policy is designed to let you know what information we

How We Collect and Use Information
</p>
<h3>Your personal details:</h3>
<p>When you register for a new account on our website, we ask for certain information such
as your username, real names, and e-mail address. When you write to us, we will not
keep any messages which we send to or receive from you through the website.
However, we will temporarily retain your username on our databases so we can identify
you when you log in. We will not publish your personal details publicly unless you say
so.</p>

<h3>Analytics information:</h3>
<p>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to
help us measure traffic and usage trends for the website. These tools collect information
sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other
information that assists us in improving the website. We collect and use this analytics
information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify
any particular individual user.</p>

<h3>Cookies information:</h3>
<p>For full details, please read our Cookie Policy. When you visit the website, we may send
one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters
— to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Wheatley Arts Festival
help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also
tell us about how you use the website (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and
other actions you take whilst browsing), and allow us to track your usage of the website</p>

<p>over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser,
but you can remove persistent cookies by following your web browser’s directions. A
session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset
your web browser to accept or refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
sent. However, if you disable cookies, some features of the website may not function
properly.</p>

<h3>How we use certain service-type information we collect about you:</h3>
<p>We use or may use cookies, other device identifiers and location data to remember you
